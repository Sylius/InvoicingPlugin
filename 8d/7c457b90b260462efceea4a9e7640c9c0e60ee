There is still one more thing to fix, I called `createQueryBuilder` which lived in EntityRepository, but the type set for `$orderRepository` is `OrderRepositoryInterface`making CI cannot pass.

Which interface or class should we set?

The best solution would be creating a custom `OrderRepository`, but it requires a custom interface, class, and configuration, which is probably not something we would like to introduce in such a simple fix :/ Maybe you can use one of the existing methods from order repository, like `createListQueryBuilder`, and then apply the not-null-number criteria on the result? It should do the trick with not much work. Thanks for the contribution!

üëç The last thing that should be done is adding a not-placed order in the background of [this feature file](https://github.com/Sylius/InvoicingPlugin/blob/master/features/managing_invoices/generating_invoices_for_previously_placed_orders.feature) to check does this query for sure works as it should work :) Do you think you would be able to do it, @tom10271?
