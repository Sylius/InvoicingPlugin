@diimpp to me it **looks** more than okay, although the build is failing 😭

@GSadee hey man, if you're taking part of the PR and merge it in another PR, please don't forget to add mention about that -- I'm spending time to rebase this PR only to see, that some changes already in master. (I'm talking about show invoice layout https://github.com/Sylius/InvoicingPlugin/pull/210/commits/06faf608c0a0aaee6fc044cb6d5559d26031aca0 https://github.com/Sylius/InvoicingPlugin/pull/210/commits/d3c516dff0b4be14db7bab784b9665dc617c1fa5)

@diimpp please rebase with master to fix the conflict, it should also fix problems with failing builds. I'm also sorry for not answering for a very long time 😞
